# Open-Cyber-Security-Platform
The Open Cyber Security Platform is an open-source project designed to provide a comprehensive endpoint detection and response (EDR) system. It integrates real-time event monitoring, efficient log management, and active response mechanisms to handle security threats dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of system activities to detect security threats or policy violations.
- **Log Management:** Utilizes Fluent Bit for efficient log shipping, ensuring that all events are recorded and processed.
- **Active Response:** Automated response capabilities similar to Wazuh, allowing for immediate reaction to detected threats.
- **Communication:** Uses NATS.io for high-throughput, low-latency messaging between endpoints and the central management system.
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports multiple platforms with a focus on macOS, utilizing Swift for development of the EDR agent.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Fluent Bit installed and configured for endpoint logging.
- NATS.io server setup for messaging.
- Swift development environment for macOS endpoint agent development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenCyberSecurityPlatform.git
   cd OpenCyberSecurityPlatform
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:** Instructions for setting up Fluent Bit, NATS.io, and other dependencies.

3. **Build the project:** Details on how to compile and build the project for different platforms.

### Usage

- Instructions on how to deploy and configure the EDR agent on endpoints.
- Guide on how to monitor and manage alerts using the central management system.

## Approach to Developing the Open Cyber Security Platform

### Project Planning

- **Define Objectives:** Clear goals for what the platform will achieve.
- **Scope Features:** Decide on the features and functionalities based on the initial objectives.
- **Resource Allocation:** Determine the resources required, including human resources and technology stacks.

### Technology Stack Selection

- **Fluent Bit:** For log collection and forwarding.
- **NATS.io:** For real-time messaging between the components.
- **Swift:** For developing the macOS-based agents.
- **Open Source Tools:** Assess and select additional open-source tools that can be integrated, such as OSSuary for cryptographic operations.

### System Architecture

- **Design System Components:** Architecture of the EDR system, how components interact, data flow, and processing.
- **Security Measures:** Design encryption, authentication, and integrity verification into the system to ensure secure operations.

### Development

- **Setup Development Environment:** Prepare the development environments for all components.
- **Iterative Development:** Develop the system in phases, with regular testing and feedback loops.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests for each component.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the components work together seamlessly.
- **Performance Testing:** Test the system under load to ensure it meets performance expectations.

### Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment Strategy:** Create a deployment plan, possibly using automated tools for rollout and updates.
- **Monitoring and Logs:** Utilize Fluent Bit for log management, and set up monitoring for system health and security.

### Community Engagement

- **Open Source Collaboration:** Encourage and manage contributions from the open-source community.
- **Documentation and Support:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support channels for users and contributors.

By following this approach and using the provided README as a starting point, you can effectively organize, develop, and maintain the Open Cyber Security Platform as an open-source project.
